//
//  This model generates a shim suitable for adjusting your toilet.
//  It is basically a series of smaller and smaller rectangles.
//  As it is parameterized, you can generate it however you want.
//
//  It also lets you print multiple copies.   By default it prints two.
//
//  This is post-card-ware.  Let me know in a comment how this worked out
//  for you.  Defect reports, and suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
//
//  I recommend you use ABS with at least a 50% fill.
//  Anything lower that 4 as a stepDepth doesn't work as well.
//  Your toilet bottom edge will vary, so it may take a print or two
//  to zero in on your desired depth.
