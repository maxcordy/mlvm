// This makes use of the $fn function to limit the number of facets (sides) of cylinders.
// So essentially this is just a cylinder with a couple of cones stacked on top.
// Setting $fn to 3 gives a 3 sided funnel (triangular) funnel.
// Setting $fn to 4 gives a 4 sided (square) funnel.
// etc. The higher the number, the more "round" it becomes.

// REALLY IMPORTANT. THE STL PRODUCES A SOLID OBJECT WHICH WON'T BE MUCH USE AS A FUNNEL. 
// TO MAKE THIS WORK, YOU NEED TO SLICE IT WITH NO TOP AND BOTTOM LAYERS, NO INFILL, BUT 3 OR 4 PERIMETERS.
// THAT WILL PRODUCE A G-CODE WHICH WILL MAKE A HOLLOW FUNNEL.

// Width across corners . NOTE this is the width across the corners, not across the flats. 
// Essentialy, the width is the diameter of a circle within which your funnel will fit.

// to set the width to approximately 1.4 times greater - i.e. 140mm.
