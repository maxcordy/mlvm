// The number of bottles along the x axis
Number_Of_Bottles_Long=5; 

// The number of bottles along the y axis
Number_Of_Bottles_Wide=5; 

// The inside diameter of the cylinders which hold the bottles.
// Measure your bottle then add a milimeter or 2 for clearance
Inside_Diameter=23; 

// The overall height in mm. Note that the depth of the hole will be this number minus the base thickness

// The base thickness in mm. For ease of printing, make this divisible by the layer height of you slicer/printer.
// So for example if the layer height is 0.3 mm use 1.8 or 2.1 but not 2.0.
Base_Thickness=1.8;  

// The wall thickness of the cylinders. Note that the cylinders are joined together by whatever this thickness is
// so DO NOT MAKE THIS ANY LESS THAN 2mm. For ease of printing, make this number divisible by your nozzle diameter.

// Suggested Slicer settings. 3 solid top and bottom layers, 2 or 3 perimiters. 20% infill. 
// Using a 0.5mm nozzle with 0.3mm layer height.
