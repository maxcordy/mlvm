/*To get this to work offline, any image must be converted to a .dat file using the tool at http://customizer.makerbot.com/image_surface. That will output an array of values from 0-1 corresponding to the greyscale values 0-255 of the image. Inverting the colors of the image will ensure that the recessed image gets subracted from other objects properly. Copy the arry to a text file. IMPORTANT: be sure that your file is actually a dat file and not e.g. foo.dat.txt. Some operating systems (like Windows 7 by default) hide the actual extension. Once the dat files are in the same directory as the .scad file, and are named properly the surface() function should work.

The way I prepared my image files was to:
	1	Import the image into gimp.
	2	Crop the image as tightly as possible
	3	Right click on the image: Image>Scale Image
	4	With the aspect ratio locked, change the Higher of the width and height to 100 pixils.
	5	Right click on the image: Image>Canvas Size
	6	With the aspect ratio UNlocked, change the Lower of the width and height to 100 pixils. Click "Center". Click "Resize".
	7	Right click on the image: Colors>Brightness-Contrast
	8	Increase the contrast to remove the effects of the resize, and get sharper edges.
	9	Export the file to jpg/gif/bmp/png (it doesnt really matter as long as the customizer tool can read the file).
	10	Open  http://customizer.makerbot.com/image_surface in a web browser.
	11	Select the file you want to convert. Click "Invert Colors".
	12	Copy the array of numbers to a text file. 
	13	File>Save As. In the drop-down menu "Save as type:" select "All files". This will allow you to actually set the extenstion to ".dat". Name the file <whatever>.dat.
	
Your image should now ceate a surface() as intended. */
