// I created this after observing an elderly person attemping to insert a coin in an Australian Aldi trolley. This design should help people by providing a flat area to push against. I have printed these at 0.2mm Layer thickness with a 0.3mm nozzle with good results. This is provided free to anyone who needs it.
