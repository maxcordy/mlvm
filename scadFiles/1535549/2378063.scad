/*
Configurable Ducting System for a Quadcopter

    According to the study below (and Richards work) the optimal optimal configuration found experimentally includes a δtip = 0.1%Dt,  rlip = 13%Dt, θd = 10◦ and Ld = 50% to 72%Dt.

    A Quick(ish) Key:
        prop_dia_upper:
            Longest Part of the Propellor.
            IDEAL: Whatever your prop measures.
        prop_spacing:
            The extra space that is added to both sides of the prop_dia_upper variable to give the inside wall of the duct.
            IDEAL: 0.1% of the dia_total, BUT you probably want more tolerance if you're printing/using cheaper props. I've left this as a millimeter value though, not a percentage so that you can define set tolerance.
        dia_total:
            Combines the variables as described above.
            IDEAL: N/A - don't change this unless you're really ripping things to pieces.
        lip_radius_pc:
            Affects the radius of the top curve of the duct, percentage based on the dia_total variable.
            IDEAL: 13%
        shroud_lower_length_pc:
            Affects the length of the duct section, based on the dia_total variable.
            IDEAL: 50 - 70%
        duct_angle:
            The angle off of vertical (Z) by which the inner duct wall pushes outwards.
            IDEAL: 10 degrees
        duct_resolution:
            Affects overall number of slices (the smoothness or quality of the end STL).
            IDEAL: 120. Higher is better, but will take ages if you go too high.

    NOTE ON REDUCING WEIGHT:
        I have a way of reducing weight -- look for the 'slice_extruded' module and replace the 'slice_final' with 'slice_final_hollow' - but be warned, you need to check that the placement doesn't leave you with overly thin walls as it does not always scale well with changes to certain variables. 
        
        You'll want to work with the translate and scale functions to find a good balance for your needs. 
        
        Comment out the 'slice_extruded' and call 'slice_final_hollow' - this will give you a cross section so that you can see what's going on and reduce render times to almost nothing.
