    Cube Puzzle
    ===========

        OpenSCAD code by Ronaldo Persiano
        for a 
        Design by George Hart

    The puzzle was designed by Geoge Hart and published in one of 
    his puzzle pages:

        http://georgehart.com/Puzzles/CubePuzzle

    It consists of two identical pieces that match to form a cube
    by turning one piece in respect to the other. The two pieces are
    separated by cutting the cube by a helicoid surface.

    This code models a puzzle cube very similar to the Hart's one 
    but it is based just on his description and images and may be 
    a bit different.

    Code Parameters

    The gap parameter defines the absolute gap in mm between two 
    assembled pieces. The default value is just a guide. Depending 
    on the calibration of the 3D printer, it is possible to reduce 
    the gap to get a better fit. The surface refinements increase 
    as the gap is reduced.

    The code generates 3 different presentations selected by the 
    parameter build. When build=="one_piece", just one piece of the 
    puzzle is generated; this is the usual presentation for producing
    a stl file for 3D printing purposes. When build=="assembled", two 
    pieces in different colors are generated in the assembled position 
    forming the cube. When build=="assembling", it is possible to see
    the assembling in any step by changing the parameter assemblyAngle;
    it also possible to have a dinamic view of the assembling with 
    View/Animate. 

    Some model variations are possible by changing two variables in 
    the section [Model variations]. The variable helixPitchRatio, 
    which defaults is 1, is a factor that defines the pitch of the 
    helicoidal surface that cuts the cube: it is multipied to the nominal
    pitch of sqrt(2)*cubeSize. The helixRotation adds a rotation to the
    helicoid about its axis. Try animate it with build = "assembled" 
    and helixRotation = 360*$t!

    For well calibrated 3D printers, it is possible to print two 
    pieces at a time interlocked in the assembled position. In this 
    case, generate the stl file with build="assembled". Some tests may
    be required to set an appropriate gap. This technique is 
    specially recomended when a value of helixPitchRatio is set well 
    smaller than 1 as a piece printed alone may require support. If a
    double extruder printer is not available, print two cubes with
    different colors and swap two pieces to get two bi-color sets. 
    Give the extra set to a friend!
